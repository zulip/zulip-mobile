# Developer guide

We target operating systems >= Android 4.4 (API 19) and >= iOS 8.0.

## Why React Native?

* Support iOS and Android with one codebase
* Familiar web programming model (React + Javascript + Flexbox)
* Cross-platform, 90% code reuse between iOS and Android platforms

## System requirements

* Android: You can build and run with any of Linux, Windows, or macOS.
* iOS: macOS only.  Many contributors use Linux or Windows and
  develop without testing on iOS.  Fortunately, React Native means
  this works fine.

## Setup

To become highly productive in working on Zulip Mobile, you'll want to set
up your development environment in several ways:

1. Building and running the app.  See [instructions below](#build-and-run).
2. An editor, or IDE, with good support for navigation and type information.
   This makes a big difference in productivity, and especially so when
   working in a codebase that's new to you.  See [the Editors / IDEs
   section](#editors--ides) below.
3. Debugging.  It's fine to skip this at first to get going, but when you're
   tackling a moderately complex issue, a good debugging setup can help a
   lot.  See [our debugging guide](debugging.md) for details, including
   setup instructions.

## Build and run

Before starting, install these dependencies if you don't have them:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), latest 8.x
  (LTS) version
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), latest stable version

If you are using macOS, upgrade to the latest version of the OS and then to
the latest Xcode.

Then, run the commands below in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile
cd zulip-mobile
yarn install
```

Unlike the [Zulip Server](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) project, we use
the host machine directly for development, instead of provisioning a VM.

To install the React Native tools, and either Xcode or the Android SDK
and Android Studio, follow the helpful instructions from React
Native upstream on
[Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
You want the tab "Building Projects with Native Code";
the "Quick Start" does not apply.

Continue those instructions until you can run the Zulip Mobile app
with either `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
You'll want to be able to use both an emulator and a physical device; but
for starting out, just get either one working so you can play with the app.

## Editors / IDEs

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an open-source IDE which supports our codebase well, with good
support for features like navigating to a definition or showing type
information.

To use it, [install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Useful extensions for VSCode

Install these three extensions, which support important aspects of our
codebase. Each extension page has install instructions at the top.

* [React Native
    Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsmobile.vscode-react-native)
* [Flow Language
    Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

#### Getting familiar with VSCode

Take a look through some of VS Code's docs.  In particular:

* Be sure to look at the [Code
  Navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved)
  doc, and try out Go to Definition (F12), Quick Open (Ctrl+P), and Open
  Symbol by Name (Ctrl+T).  These can make it much faster to move around
  our codebase to read and understand it.
* Get the [keyboard shortcuts PDF
  reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference)
  for your platform, and print it out.  It's a one-page PDF which is
  extremely helpful to refer to.

For the extensions to work properly, make sure that VSCode has recognized the [.vscode settings](
https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/tree/master/.vscode/settings.json) in the zulip-mobile repository.
Usually, this should happen automatically when you open the `zulip-mobile` folder in VSCode.
You can verify that the .vscode settings were recognized by opening your Workspace Settings
with `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Open Workspace Settings`. If the editor on the right side starts with the
comment
```js
// Workspace Settings for the zulip-mobile repo.
```
you're all set - VSCode has recognized your workspace settings. If not, make sure that you opened
VSCode as a folder. Do this by pressing `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` and navigate to your local `zulip-mobile`
clone.

## Android tips

* To set up the Android emulator, follow the heading "Using a virtual device"
  in those React Native
  [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
  instructions.
* After you set up the Android emulator, you no longer need Android
  Studio.  You can start the emulator [from the command
  line](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline.html).
* When running on a physical device, if the device has Zulip installed
  from the Play Store, you may need to uninstall that version first.
* Commands once you've set up:
  * `react-native run-android` - build and run on an active emulator
    or USB-connected device
  * `npm run android-min` or `npm run android-max` - runs in an Android emulator, emulator has to be run manually before this command

## iOS tips

More wrinkles are involved; see our separate doc on [iOS tips](ios-tips.md).

## Troubleshooting

### App shows a blank white screen

If you're developing on a Linux machine, and when you start the dev version of
the app (either in an emulator or on a device) you just get a blank white
screen, you may have hit your system's limit for inotify watches.  You can
increase this limit with the following commands:
```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Other issues

If you are having issues running the code on your machine, either for the first time or after updating an outdated code with the latest, please run:

```
npm run reinstall
```

Optionally, reset iOS simulator:

```
iOS Menu > Simulator > Reset Content and Settingsâ€¦
```

## Signing in to a local dev VM

This process needs improvement and has too many manual steps at the moment.
(It's not required for most development -- you can use chat.zulip.org,
or another live Zulip community you belong to, for testing the mobile app.)

If you haven't already, you'll want to install and provision a
[Zulip Server dev VM](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html).

First, you'll need to connect your dev machine and iOS device to the same
network. If you're running Zulip inside of a VM, you may also need to
configure your VM to use a public network. See more information on this [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/public_network.html).

Next, you'll need to change all instances of `localhost:9991` in both the
`/src` directory and the Xcode iOS project (located in `/ios`) to point to
the IP and port of your Vagrant VM.

Finally, run the Xcode project inside of `/ios` with your iOS device as the
target.

## Formatting code using prettier

* Using atom editor - install the `prettier-atom` plugin
* Using the command line - run `npm run prettier`
