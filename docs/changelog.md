# Version History

The date on a release generally reflects when the source commit was
tagged and the release build was first posted to GitHub or our alpha
channels on the Play Store and Apple's App Store.  The main rollout
to users in general on the app stores is typically a few days later.


#### Version numbering

We number our versions like so:

* Android requires a monotonically increasing integer version ID.
  Call that N.  We increment it on each release, including those that
  only go to alpha or beta.

* Then we use version numbers A.B.N, where N is that same N, and...
  * A is incremented for "a major release", whatever that means. (It's
    a bit of an arbitrary choice we make when making the release.)
  * B is reset to zero on "a major release", and otherwise incremented.


#### "Resolved issues"

The list of "Resolved issues" on each release is intended to be
* comprehensive,
* as a list of issues we believe were resolved by changes in that
  release -- a bug fixed, feature implemented, or desired change made.

It doesn't include
* duplicate issues
* issues we determined had been fixed, but don't know when
* issues we closed because we decided not to make the requested
  change, or couldn't make use of the bug report

experience.


### Highlights for developers

* Fixed a Jest test flake on ZulipAsyncStorage. (#4994)

* Cleaned up some code in src/utils/recipients.js. (#5011)

  device in silent mode. (#4897)

Plus, like every release, many other fixes and improvements for your Zulip
experience.


### Highlights for developers

* Sentry is now fully set up for Android-native code. (PR #4996)

* The types PmOutbox and StreamOutbox are now distinguished more fully.
  (PR #4998)

* We now require sender_id, server, and realm_uri in notification data,
  rejecting forms from servers we no longer support. (PR #4967)

* We've prepared the persistent-data storage code so it's easier to add
  transaction logic and make it sound: #4841. We've also narrowed the race
  window to mitigate the symptoms of that issue, by using
  `AsyncStorage.multiSet` and by separating the serialization step from the
  storage step. (PR #4694)

* Outbox values now have a stream_id. (PR #5000)

* We've improved the Sentry logging for an unexpected report from the
  invariant in RawLabel. (PR #5004)

experience.


### Highlights for developers

  "main", as part of the shift in the broader Git community toward this more
  inclusive convention. Please see "#announce > Git branch renamed to ‘main’"
  on the Zulip community server (CZO) to learn more.

* Upgraded to React Native v0.64! (#4426)

  This introduces two new warnings, and you can ignore them both: one
  when you run `yarn`, and one when you run Jest. Those will disappear
  once we use a version of `jest-expo` that targets RN v0.64. (We
  expect a release from them soon.)

* Resolved issues (earliest first): PR #4973, PR #4831, PR #4981,
  #4907, #4951, #4909, #3472, #4426, PR #4992

### Highlights for developers

* Upgraded Flow to v0.126.  In particular this means exact object
  types work correctly with indexer properties: `{| [string]: Foo |}`.
  (PR #4518)

    in the Sentry event. (#4452)
  * An error in handling an event now affects just that one event.
    (PR #4611)

* The `state.unread.streams` model is now an efficient data structure

Plus, like every release, many other fixes and improvements for your
Zulip experience.


### Highlights for developers

* Upgraded to React Native v0.63 -- the current latest version! (#4245)

* We've significantly refactored how we handle navigation, aiming to
  make it simpler and better support changes we want to make.  This
  came in PRs #4443, #4441, #4440, #4428, #4430, following PR #4393
  which upgraded us to React Navigation v5 (issue #4296).
  More to come.

* Improvements to our data structures continue:
  * Most uses of emails to identify users have been switched to
    user IDs. (PR #4424; mostly completes #3764)
  * `state.messages` is an `Immutable.Map`. (#4390)
  * Our various Redux sub-reducers now receive the global Redux state,
    allowing us to optimize some algorithms and drop some hacks we'd
    had for partial versions of the same thing. (PR #4437)
  * User IDs have a distinct `UserId` type: simply `number` at
    runtime, but the type-checker tracks the distinction. (PR #4421)

* Sentry error reports didn't include the Zulip server version in the
  case of uncaught exceptions; now they do. (PR #4493)

* Development on Windows was broken, and works again. (#4297)

* We have new, detailed instructions for profiling and benchmarking
  the app. (PR #4314)

* Resolved issues (latest to earliest): PR #4485, PR #4493, #4453,
  #4458, #4460, #4405, #4469, PR #4467, #4449, #4267, #4083, #4365, #4245,
  #4422, #4369, #4296, #4401, #4297, #4232, #4306, #3133, #4385.


## 27.158 (2021-01-07)

(This was a beta-only release.)


### Highlights for users

* (iOS) Viewing a conversation now takes you to the right point in the
  history, including the first time. (#3457, #4357)
* (iOS) Scrolling through lots of messages is now fast. (#3557)
* Support the Zulip "spoilers" feature. (#4155)
* People's avatars now show up crisply, without pixelation. (#4305)

Plus, like every release, many other fixes and improvements for your
Zulip experience.


### Highlights for developers

* The representation of narrows, and particularly of PM conversations,
  has been greatly refactored.  It should now be much simpler to write
  and understand code dealing with them, and especially to write it
  without introducing subtle bugs. (PRs #4382, #4368, #4364, #4361,
  #4356, #4346, #4342, #4339, #4335, #4332, #4330)
  * A new Narrow type straightforwardly follows the structure of the
    information we're representing, in place of the old data
    structures which mirrored the wire format for the much more
    complex get-messages API of the server. (PRs #4346, #4342, #4339)
  * PM conversations are represented with the users' IDs, not
    emails. (PR #4382, PR #4346)
  * The `recipient` module offers a suite of functions for explicitly
    translating between the remaining different ways that different
    data structures encode PM conversations. (#4035, PR #4356,
    PR #4335, PR #4332)

* We now use GitHub Actions for our CI, instead of Travis CI.  This
  should be a much more stable platform; it's faster (builds take
  about 8-9 minutes, vs. 9-12 minutes on Travis); and it may also help
  us make it run faster still and produce clearer output. (#4174)
* Sentry error reports now include the Zulip server version. (#3745)
* Developer scripts now support NixOS (by using `#!/usr/bin/env`.)
  (PR #4366)

* Resolved issues (latest to earliest): #4388, PR #4387, #4155, #4174,
  PR #4373, #4357, #3457, PR #4367, PR #4366, PR #4350, #4035, #3557,
  #2750, #4338, #4157, #4305, #4307, #3745.


## 27.157 (2020-11-12)

### Highlights for users

* Fixed several bugs related to opening a notification. (#4290, #4293,
  PR #3922)

Plus, like every release, many other fixes and improvements for your
Zulip experience.


### Highlights for developers

* We no longer tie in our navigation with Redux; we no longer use
  react-navigation-redux-helpers. (#3804)
* Bumped targetSdkVersion to 29, aka Android 10. (#3665)
* Dropped iOS 10 support; now iOS 11+. (c953bc336)
* Resolved issues (latest to earliest): #4303, #4298, #4301, #3804,
  #4293, #3324, #4290, PR #3922, #3665, #2756 (at 78a62b249), #4281,
  #4100.


## 27.156 (2020-10-10)

* Fixed crashes in the pre-alpha release 27.155. (#4270, #4275)

For other changes since last production release, see 27.155.


## (pre-alpha) 27.155 (2020-09-23)

Plus, like every release, other fixes and improvements for your Zulip
experience.


### Highlights for developers

* #4151: Upgraded to RN v0.61!
* PR #4204: New script tools/run-android to replace
  `react-native run-android`, which turns out to have never quite
  worked correctly (even with the hacks we'd had to try to help it.)


## 26.30.153 (2020-07-06)

### Highlights for users

* You can now sign in with an Apple ID. (#3964)

Plus, like every release, other fixes and improvements for your Zulip

### Highlights for users

* (Android) Fixed bug in downloading an image from a message. (#3124)
* (Android) Fixed bug in viewing a file attached to a message. (#3303)

Plus, like every release, other fixes and improvements for your Zulip
experience.


### Highlights for developers

(Note that although #3124 and #3303 are related, and the news on both
is for Android users only, their status on iOS differs: with #3124 the

### Highlights for developers

This is a regular release from the main branch following 26.18.141.
In addition to the changes mentioned here, it includes the changes
that were cherry-picked for 26.19.142.

* New test suite `pirlo` (#3669), which runs an end-to-end smoketest
  of an Android release build in the cloud using pirlo.io.

* Improvements to Sentry logging (#3733): instead of interpolating
  details of an event into the message string, we now typically use
  the Sentry "extras" mechanism to attach the data, and leave the
  message string constant.  This causes Sentry to keep the events
  grouped as a single issue even when the data varies.

* Resolved issues: #3570, #3711, #3715, #3631 (showing long topic
  names), #3752, #3739 (decoding non-ASCII in narrow-links)

  been getting updated.)

## 24.0.113 (2019-03-29)

### Highlights for users

Many fixes and improvements, including:
* The app now fetches more messages more eagerly when scrolling
  through the message list, so you'll less often have to wait.
* Long-pressing a link in a message copies the link.
* The special `:zulip:` emoji.
* A new complete translation for Romanian, and updates for Czech,
  Turkish, and Italian.


### Full changes for users

* Touching a user's avatar or name in the app bar above a message list
  leads to their profile.
* Fetch more messages sooner, to reduce user waiting. (6ccf3a297)
* Adjusted text on "Switch account" and "Log out" buttons.
* The special `:zulip:` emoji is now supported. (#2375)
* User status / "unavailable" feature more fully supported. (#3417)
* Azure AD authentication backend supported, when enabled on server. (#3227)
* On iOS when displaying the message list, switched a major
  system-provided component ("WebView") to a newer version offering
  performance and stability improvements. (#3296)
* Complete translation into Romanian from scratch; translation updates
  for Czech, Turkish, and Italian.
* Fixed a bug on iOS where long-pressing something in the message list
  could act like a normal press after the long-press. (#3429)
* When a message contains a link, you can now copy the link by
  long-pressing it. (#3385)


### Highlights for developers

* The Android app now supports Kotlin!  In fact we're migrating to
  Kotlin -- new code will be in Kotlin.  See
  [doc](architecture/android.md#kotlin-and-java).

* The Android app now has unit tests!  Just a few so far -- but now
  that we have a model to follow, we'll write them for other code
  as appropriate.  See [doc](howto/testing.md#unit-tests-android).

* We've begun using a "crunchy shell, soft center" pattern in handling
  data from the server.  This means all parsing of messy
  data-from-the-network happens at the edge (the "crunchy shell") --
  and constructs new, clean data structures with an exactly known
  format.  Then the rest of the app can be a "soft center", with many
  fewer boring checks, so the real application logic it's expressing
  easier to read and the code is less prone to bugs.

  So far this is demonstrated in parsing of notification data
  (i.e. FCM messages) in our Android code, in [FcmMessage.kt].
  See also discussion in the commit message of f85d3250f.
  The same pattern works great in JS too, and we may gradually 
  also move to it there.

[FcmMessage.kt]: ../android/app/src/main/java/com/zulipmobile/notifications/FcmMessage.kt

* We've begun to put small single-use helper React components in the
  same file where they're used, and in general to put several React
  components in a file when that makes the code clearer.  Disabled the
  lint rule that would complain about that.  Discussion in cb418f134,
  examples in 7f7620811 and parent.


### Other changes for developers

* Types for the server API significantly reorganized: moved
  initial-data types in from app's `types.js`, and separated out model
  types and generic protocol/transport types in their own files.
  (12bc3e801^..958bc2b7e)
* Types for our Redux state separated out and organized.
  (cc945867a^..4bc77bdab)
* `Touchable` revised to more effectively cover up a subtle,
  regrettable difference between upstream RN's interfaces for the
  implementations we use on Android vs. iOS. (ec32af1a4, f44114b2b)
* Fixed most remaining violations of Flow's `strict-local`; just 8
  files remain without it. (dd03939cb^..d298669ef)


## 23.3.112 (2019-03-04)

  displays. (#3329)

### Changes for developers

#### Highlights of important updates to know

All active developers will benefit from knowing about these.  More
details on each in subsections below.

* Major typing upgrades, including:
  * Exact object types -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 61d2e3426.
  * Intersection types -- probably never use them.
    Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a.
  * Read-only arrays -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 4c3aaa0b1.

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.
  All new code should follow.  Examples in a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2,
  f6ddc2dba.

* The type `Account` is no longer the same as `Auth`.
  In either case, `Identity` is preferred where it suffices.
  Changed in 5738ccb6f, as part of notifications changes.

* `getAuth` and other account-related selectors no longer return
  malformed data.  Some throw; others explicitly can return
  `undefined`.  Interfaces in jsdoc in `accountsSelectors.js`;
  discussion in 33a4df218.

* We no longer lie to Redux through `areStatesEqual`!  See #3163.

* Automated refactoring is pretty great!  Discussion in e566058bf of
  one approach.  Lower-tech approaches already helped powerfully for
  migrating to exact types, and to new `styles` API.


#### Workflow improvements

* Experimented with automated refactoring: an AST-based tool
  `jscodeshift`, and lower-tech Perl one-liners.  (`jscodeshift`
  discussed in e566058bf, used in 47365203f.  Perl one-liners on
  several occasions; see `git log --grep perl`.)

* `tools/test` accepts `--diff COMMIT`: run only on files changed
  since `COMMIT` (vs. default of files changed in current branch.)
  (1fe380e1a)

* Reactotron disabled by default, because it broke basic app
  functionality. :'-( (170ed2a32, 598386524)

* New script `tools/changelog` streamlines some steps of making a
  release. (593d38d06^..9dfb52e24)


#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* Most object types are now exact.  Let's do more of that.
  (Discussion in 61d2e3426; additional changes in
  a15c00e1a^..b9b48657f, 703739338, e5e57abe3^..9c1898242)

* Intersection types nearly all replaced with object spread.
  (Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a; additional changes in
  eb3783b1a^..47365203f)

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.  Most
  existing code migrated; all new code should follow. (examples in
  a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2, f6ddc2dba; fuller changes in
  112f99be9^..8dad2d191, 1f71edad9^..a4e0f23b3)

* Major parts of notifications code rewritten, others refactored;
  the wix `react-native-notifications` library reduced to a small
  role.  (Context in #2877.  Changes in 410041dfa^..2ed116267,
  dcbe2ac86^..d6454eb50, 034e25be8^..3a2076e0f, f1eae82d8^..233d68c40)

* Rewrote `accountsSelectors.js`.  Now `getAuth` can only return a
  real, authentication-bearing value.  (Discussion in 33a4df218;
  changes in 3706965d3^..614f56bd2, f1eae82d8)

* Removed the `connectPreserveOnBackOption` hack, where we told lies
  to Redux via `areStatesEqual`. (#3163, da6c43d4b^..cd7b25757)

* Server API bindings describe more routes (even that the app doesn't
  use); route bindings have a more uniform signature, and link to API
  docs. (1acf7d96a^..8170045d8, 0af4af22b^..6becc6e91

* We subscribe to all server events with our queue.
  (d8b36412c^..6c7fffc76)

* Logic fixes in Android notification UI code for sound and vibration;
  no visible changes yet. (125dc0806^..458ef8832)

* Don't run old migrations on first install. (863bca711)

* Don't use `console.warn`. (21f64aad7)

* More read-only array types. (4c3aaa0b1)

* Translated-message files moved out of `src/`, to `static`, to avoid
  spamming grep results. (1fc26a512)

* Upgraded RN to v0.57.8, from v0.57.1. (c03c85684^..ca759b106,
  329dd67f0)

* New script `tools/upgrade` to help systematize upgrading
  dependencies. (b64ce0023^..eb130c631)



## 21.2.106 (2018-12-12)

### Highlights for users (since 20.0.103)

Many fixes and improvements, including:
* Full support for custom emoji, including in composing messages and
  in reactions.

* Fixed bug: a message view seen shortly after starting the app could
  show "No messages".
* Fixed bug: uploading an image while viewing a stream would go to the
  wrong topic.
* Fixed bug: a draft message typed just after starting the app was
  lost.
* Complete translations for Italian and Korean.


### Full changes for users (since 21.1.105)

* Fixed a regression in 21.0.104: the autocomplete popup would sometimes
  not respond when touched. (#3209)


## (beta) 21.1.105 (2018-12-11)

This was a beta version that did not become a production release;
see above.


### Full changes for users (since 21.0.104)

  could show "No messages". (#3162)
* Fixed issue where uploading an image while viewing a stream would go
  to the wrong topic. (#3130)

  a server was rendered in a broken way, looking empty. (#3182)


### Full changes for developers (since 21.0.104)

#### Workflow improvements

* `tools/test` accepts a `--fix` option.  (177d3eaa9)


#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* New internal API `withGetText` for acquiring a handy
  string-translating function, to use in any part of the app that
  isn't a React component. (#2812; c22dfee9b^..9eaa05c27)
* New experimental internal API for the (server) API bindings:
  `import api from ...`, then `api.sendMessage(...)` etc.
  (63ae59808^..acb979cf5)
* We no longer write `props: Props`, or where applicable
  `state: State`, at the top of each React component; the type
  arguments to `PureComponent` or `Component` express that already.
  (7e3becfba, c5df77962)
* A good swath of our uses of `any` and `Object` are replaced with
  real types, and 20 more files are marked strict-local; 60 to go.
  (9a0df7416^..60f14ed83)


## (beta) 21.0.104 (2018-12-05)

  corners, like individual avatars. (#3167)
* Fixed bugs causing top bar to sometimes be white instead of
  stream-colored. (#2797, #3139)

* New `caseNarrow` abstraction for working with narrow objects.
  (fa6134aa6^..e9fe1e801)
* Explain `Auth` vs. `Account` types, and introduce distinct
  `Identity`. (f5a2603a4^..28b1177d3)

  many files, fixing newly-exposed type issues. (#3164, 6efa7980c,
