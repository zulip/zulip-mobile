# Version History

The date on a release generally reflects when the source commit was
tagged and the release build was first posted to GitHub or our alpha
channels on the Play Store and Apple's App Store.  The main rollout
to users in general on the app stores is typically a few days later.


#### Version numbering

We number our versions like so:

* Android requires a monotonically increasing integer version ID.
  Call that N.  We increment it on each release, including those that
  only go to alpha or beta.

* Then we use version numbers A.B.N, where N is that same N, and...
  * A is incremented for "a major release", whatever that means. (It's
    a bit of an arbitrary choice we make when making the release.)
  * B is reset to zero on "a major release", and otherwise incremented.


#### "Resolved issues"

The list of "Resolved issues" on each release is intended to be
* comprehensive,
* as a list of issues we believe were resolved by changes in that
  release -- a bug fixed, feature implemented, or desired change made.

It doesn't include
* duplicate issues
* issues we determined had been fixed, but don't know when
* issues we closed because we decided not to make the requested
  change, or couldn't make use of the bug report


## Unreleased


## 26.21.144 (2020-01-31)

### Highlights for users

* Animated GIFs now animate, even when shown full-screen.
* When you type a very long message, the input box no longer overflows
  the screen.

Plus, like every release, other fixes and improvements for your Zulip
experience.


### Highlights for developers

* Resolved issues, user-facing:
  * #3497: animated GIFs in lightbox
  * #3551: show in user profile when user is deactivated
  * #3760: UI glitch in "create stream" flow
  * #3614: keep compose box appropriately sized when message is long
  * #3528: drop "Reply" in message action sheet for PM or topic narrow

* Resolved issues, developer-facing:
  * #3768: Flow bug affecting `connect`
  * #3801: document how to use React DevTools
  * #3827: type fixes for upcoming Flow upgrade
  * #3783: build failure on macOS
  * #3777: build failure on Windows


## 26.20.143 (2020-01-07)

### Highlights for users

* When a topic's name is too long to fit in the UI, you can long-press
  the topic to show it in full.
* Links to conversations now work correctly for streams and topics
  with names that go beyond ASCII characters.

Plus, like every release, other fixes and improvements for your Zulip
experience.


### Highlights for developers

This is a regular release from the master branch following 26.18.141.
In addition to the changes mentioned here, it includes the changes
that were cherry-picked for 26.19.142.

* New test suite `pirlo` (#3669), which runs an end-to-end smoketest
  of an Android release build in the cloud using pirlo.io.

* Improvements to Sentry logging (#3733): instead of interpolating
  details of an event into the message string, we now typically use
  the Sentry "extras" mechanism to attach the data, and leave the
  message string constant.  This causes Sentry to keep the events
  grouped as a single issue even when the data varies.

* Resolved issues: #3570, #3711, #3715, #3631 (showing long topic
  names), #3752, #3739 (decoding non-ASCII in narrow-links)

## 24.0.113 (2019-03-29)

### Highlights for users

Many fixes and improvements, including:

  through the message list, so you'll less often have to wait.
* Long-pressing a link in a message copies the link.
* The special `:zulip:` emoji.
* A new complete translation for Romanian, and updates for Czech,
  Turkish, and Italian.


### Full changes for users

* Touching a user's avatar or name in the app bar above a message list
  leads to their profile.
* Fetch more messages sooner, to reduce user waiting. (6ccf3a297)
* Adjusted text on "Switch account" and "Log out" buttons.
* The special `:zulip:` emoji is now supported. (#2375)
* User status / "unavailable" feature more fully supported. (#3417)
* Azure AD authentication backend supported, when enabled on server. (#3227)
* On iOS when displaying the message list, switched a major
  system-provided component ("WebView") to a newer version offering
  performance and stability improvements. (#3296)
* Complete translation into Romanian from scratch; translation updates
  for Czech, Turkish, and Italian.
* Fixed a bug on iOS where long-pressing something in the message list
  could act like a normal press after the long-press. (#3429)
* When a message contains a link, you can now copy the link by
  long-pressing it. (#3385)


### Highlights for developers

* The Android app now supports Kotlin!  In fact we're migrating to
  Kotlin -- new code will be in Kotlin.  See
  [doc](architecture/android.md#kotlin-and-java).

* The Android app now has unit tests!  Just a few so far -- but now
  that we have a model to follow, we'll write them for other code
  as appropriate.  See [doc](howto/testing.md#unit-tests-android).

* We've begun using a "crunchy shell, soft center" pattern in handling
  data from the server.  This means all parsing of messy
  data-from-the-network happens at the edge (the "crunchy shell") --
  and constructs new, clean data structures with an exactly known
  format.  Then the rest of the app can be a "soft center", with many
  fewer boring checks, so the real application logic it's expressing
  easier to read and the code is less prone to bugs.

  So far this is demonstrated in parsing of notification data
  (i.e. FCM messages) in our Android code, in [FcmMessage.kt].
  See also discussion in the commit message of f85d3250f.
  The same pattern works great in JS too, and we may gradually 
  also move to it there.

[FcmMessage.kt]: ../android/app/src/main/java/com/zulipmobile/notifications/FcmMessage.kt

* We've begun to put small single-use helper React components in the
  same file where they're used, and in general to put several React
  components in a file when that makes the code clearer.  Disabled the
  lint rule that would complain about that.  Discussion in cb418f134,
  examples in 7f7620811 and parent.


### Other changes for developers

* Types for the server API significantly reorganized: moved
  initial-data types in from app's `types.js`, and separated out model
  types and generic protocol/transport types in their own files.
  (12bc3e801^..958bc2b7e)
* Types for our Redux state separated out and organized.
  (cc945867a^..4bc77bdab)
* `Touchable` revised to more effectively cover up a subtle,
  regrettable difference between upstream RN's interfaces for the
  implementations we use on Android vs. iOS. (ec32af1a4, f44114b2b)
* Fixed most remaining violations of Flow's `strict-local`; just 8
  files remain without it. (dd03939cb^..d298669ef)


## 23.3.112 (2019-03-04)

  displays. (#3329)
* Fixed color of user-group icon in @-mention autocomplete in dark
  mode. (#3366)
* Support batched remove-notification events, on Android. (#3343)
* Translation updates for Turkish. (a6b548999)


### Full changes for developers

* Improved documentation for developing against a dev server.
  (e62f84f2d)
* Small improvements to Git documentation. (f018461d4)

### Changes for developers

#### Highlights of important updates to know

All active developers will benefit from knowing about these.  More
details on each in subsections below.

* Major typing upgrades, including:
  * Exact object types -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 61d2e3426.
  * Intersection types -- probably never use them.
    Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a.
  * Read-only arrays -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 4c3aaa0b1.

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.
  All new code should follow.  Examples in a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2,
  f6ddc2dba.

* The type `Account` is no longer the same as `Auth`.
  In either case, `Identity` is preferred where it suffices.
  Changed in 5738ccb6f, as part of notifications changes.

* `getAuth` and other account-related selectors no longer return
  malformed data.  Some throw; others explicitly can return
  `undefined`.  Interfaces in jsdoc in `accountsSelectors.js`;
  discussion in 33a4df218.

* We no longer lie to Redux through `areStatesEqual`!  See #3163.

* Automated refactoring is pretty great!  Discussion in e566058bf of
  one approach.  Lower-tech approaches already helped powerfully for
  migrating to exact types, and to new `styles` API.


#### Workflow improvements

* Experimented with automated refactoring: an AST-based tool
  `jscodeshift`, and lower-tech Perl one-liners.  (`jscodeshift`
  discussed in e566058bf, used in 47365203f.  Perl one-liners on
  several occasions; see `git log --grep perl`.)

* `tools/test` accepts `--diff COMMIT`: run only on files changed
  since `COMMIT` (vs. default of files changed in current branch.)
  (1fe380e1a)

* Reactotron disabled by default, because it broke basic app
  functionality. :'-( (170ed2a32, 598386524)

* New script `tools/changelog` streamlines some steps of making a
  release. (593d38d06^..9dfb52e24)


#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* Most object types are now exact.  Let's do more of that.
  (Discussion in 61d2e3426; additional changes in
  a15c00e1a^..b9b48657f, 703739338, e5e57abe3^..9c1898242)

* Intersection types nearly all replaced with object spread.
  (Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a; additional changes in
  eb3783b1a^..47365203f)

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.  Most
  existing code migrated; all new code should follow. (examples in
  a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2, f6ddc2dba; fuller changes in
  112f99be9^..8dad2d191, 1f71edad9^..a4e0f23b3)

* Major parts of notifications code rewritten, others refactored;
  the wix `react-native-notifications` library reduced to a small
  role.  (Context in #2877.  Changes in 410041dfa^..2ed116267,
  dcbe2ac86^..d6454eb50, 034e25be8^..3a2076e0f, f1eae82d8^..233d68c40)

* Rewrote `accountsSelectors.js`.  Now `getAuth` can only return a
  real, authentication-bearing value.  (Discussion in 33a4df218;
  changes in 3706965d3^..614f56bd2, f1eae82d8)

* Removed the `connectPreserveOnBackOption` hack, where we told lies
  to Redux via `areStatesEqual`. (#3163, da6c43d4b^..cd7b25757)

* Server API bindings describe more routes (even that the app doesn't
  use); route bindings have a more uniform signature, and link to API
  docs. (1acf7d96a^..8170045d8, 0af4af22b^..6becc6e91

  lost.
* Complete translations for Italian and Korean.

#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* New internal API `withGetText` for acquiring a handy
  string-translating function, to use in any part of the app that
  isn't a React component. (#2812; c22dfee9b^..9eaa05c27)

  `state: State`, at the top of each React component; the type

* A good swath of our uses of `any` and `Object` are replaced with
  real types, and 20 more files are marked strict-local; 60 to go.
