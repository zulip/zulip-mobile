# Version History

The date on a release generally reflects when the source commit was
tagged and the release build was first posted to GitHub or our alpha
channels on the Play Store and Apple's App Store.  The main rollout
to users in general on the app stores is typically a few days later.


#### Version numbering

We number our versions like so:

* Android requires a monotonically increasing integer version ID.
  Call that N.  We increment it on each release, including those that
  only go to alpha or beta.

* Then we use version numbers A.B.N, where N is that same N, and...
  * A is incremented for "a major release", whatever that means. (It's
    a bit of an arbitrary choice we make when making the release.)
  * B is reset to zero on "a major release", and otherwise incremented.


#### "Resolved issues"

The list of "Resolved issues" on each release is intended to be
* comprehensive,
* as a list of issues we believe were resolved by changes in that
  release -- a bug fixed, feature implemented, or desired change made.

It doesn't include
* duplicate issues
* issues we determined had been fixed, but don't know when
* issues we closed because we decided not to make the requested
  change, or couldn't make use of the bug report

In addition to the changes mentioned here, it includes the changes
that were cherry-picked for 26.19.142.

* New test suite `pirlo` (#3669), which runs an end-to-end smoketest

* Improvements to Sentry logging (#3733): instead of interpolating
  details of an event into the message string, we now typically use
  the Sentry "extras" mechanism to attach the data, and leave the
  message string constant.  This causes Sentry to keep the events
  grouped as a single issue even when the data varies.

  names), #3752, #3739 (decoding non-ASCII in narrow-links)

  leads to their profile.
* Fetch more messages sooner, to reduce user waiting. (6ccf3a297)
* Adjusted text on "Switch account" and "Log out" buttons.
* The special `:zulip:` emoji is now supported. (#2375)
* User status / "unavailable" feature more fully supported. (#3417)
* Azure AD authentication backend supported, when enabled on server. (#3227)
* On iOS when displaying the message list, switched a major
  system-provided component ("WebView") to a newer version offering
  performance and stability improvements. (#3296)
* Complete translation into Romanian from scratch; translation updates
  for Czech, Turkish, and Italian.
* Fixed a bug on iOS where long-pressing something in the message list
  could act like a normal press after the long-press. (#3429)
* When a message contains a link, you can now copy the link by
  long-pressing it. (#3385)


### Highlights for developers

* The Android app now supports Kotlin!  In fact we're migrating to
  Kotlin -- new code will be in Kotlin.  See
  [doc](architecture/android.md#kotlin-and-java).

* The Android app now has unit tests!  Just a few so far -- but now
  that we have a model to follow, we'll write them for other code
  as appropriate.  See [doc](howto/testing.md#unit-tests-android).

* We've begun using a "crunchy shell, soft center" pattern in handling
  data from the server.  This means all parsing of messy
  data-from-the-network happens at the edge (the "crunchy shell") --
  and constructs new, clean data structures with an exactly known
  format.  Then the rest of the app can be a "soft center", with many
  fewer boring checks, so the real application logic it's expressing
  easier to read and the code is less prone to bugs.

  So far this is demonstrated in parsing of notification data
  (i.e. FCM messages) in our Android code, in [FcmMessage.kt].
  See also discussion in the commit message of f85d3250f.
  The same pattern works great in JS too, and we may gradually 
  also move to it there.

[FcmMessage.kt]: ../android/app/src/main/java/com/zulipmobile/notifications/FcmMessage.kt

* We've begun to put small single-use helper React components in the
  same file where they're used, and in general to put several React
  components in a file when that makes the code clearer.  Disabled the
  lint rule that would complain about that.  Discussion in cb418f134,
  examples in 7f7620811 and parent.


### Other changes for developers

* Types for the server API significantly reorganized: moved
  initial-data types in from app's `types.js`, and separated out model
  types and generic protocol/transport types in their own files.
  (12bc3e801^..958bc2b7e)
* Types for our Redux state separated out and organized.
  (cc945867a^..4bc77bdab)
* `Touchable` revised to more effectively cover up a subtle,
  regrettable difference between upstream RN's interfaces for the
  implementations we use on Android vs. iOS. (ec32af1a4, f44114b2b)
* Fixed most remaining violations of Flow's `strict-local`; just 8
  files remain without it. (dd03939cb^..d298669ef)

### Changes for developers

#### Highlights of important updates to know

All active developers will benefit from knowing about these.  More
details on each in subsections below.

* Major typing upgrades, including:
  * Exact object types -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 61d2e3426.
  * Intersection types -- probably never use them.
    Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a.
  * Read-only arrays -- use them in most cases.
    Discussion in 4c3aaa0b1.

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.
  All new code should follow.  Examples in a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2,
  f6ddc2dba.

* The type `Account` is no longer the same as `Auth`.
  In either case, `Identity` is preferred where it suffices.
  Changed in 5738ccb6f, as part of notifications changes.

* `getAuth` and other account-related selectors no longer return
  malformed data.  Some throw; others explicitly can return
  `undefined`.  Interfaces in jsdoc in `accountsSelectors.js`;
  discussion in 33a4df218.

* We no longer lie to Redux through `areStatesEqual`!  See #3163.

* Automated refactoring is pretty great!  Discussion in e566058bf of
  one approach.  Lower-tech approaches already helped powerfully for
  migrating to exact types, and to new `styles` API.


#### Workflow improvements

* Experimented with automated refactoring: an AST-based tool
  `jscodeshift`, and lower-tech Perl one-liners.  (`jscodeshift`
  discussed in e566058bf, used in 47365203f.  Perl one-liners on
  several occasions; see `git log --grep perl`.)

* `tools/test` accepts `--diff COMMIT`: run only on files changed
  since `COMMIT` (vs. default of files changed in current branch.)
  (1fe380e1a)

* Reactotron disabled by default, because it broke basic app
  functionality. :'-( (170ed2a32, 598386524)

* New script `tools/changelog` streamlines some steps of making a
  release. (593d38d06^..9dfb52e24)


#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* Most object types are now exact.  Let's do more of that.
  (Discussion in 61d2e3426; additional changes in
  a15c00e1a^..b9b48657f, 703739338, e5e57abe3^..9c1898242)

* Intersection types nearly all replaced with object spread.
  (Discussion in ff515bc9d and 124a2f39a; additional changes in
  eb3783b1a^..47365203f)

* New patterns for getting styles: static where possible, and
  otherwise using new React context API instead of legacy one.  Most
  existing code migrated; all new code should follow. (examples in
  a2bfcb41b, 51dd1b3b2, f6ddc2dba; fuller changes in
  112f99be9^..8dad2d191, 1f71edad9^..a4e0f23b3)

* Major parts of notifications code rewritten, others refactored;
  the wix `react-native-notifications` library reduced to a small
  role.  (Context in #2877.  Changes in 410041dfa^..2ed116267,
  dcbe2ac86^..d6454eb50, 034e25be8^..3a2076e0f, f1eae82d8^..233d68c40)

* Rewrote `accountsSelectors.js`.  Now `getAuth` can only return a
  real, authentication-bearing value.  (Discussion in 33a4df218;
  changes in 3706965d3^..614f56bd2, f1eae82d8)

* Removed the `connectPreserveOnBackOption` hack, where we told lies
  to Redux via `areStatesEqual`. (#3163, da6c43d4b^..cd7b25757)

* Server API bindings describe more routes (even that the app doesn't
  use); route bindings have a more uniform signature, and link to API
  docs. (1acf7d96a^..8170045d8, 0af4af22b^..6becc6e91

* We subscribe to all server events with our queue.
  (d8b36412c^..6c7fffc76)

* Logic fixes in Android notification UI code for sound and vibration;
  no visible changes yet. (125dc0806^..458ef8832)

* Don't run old migrations on first install. (863bca711)

* Don't use `console.warn`. (21f64aad7)

* More read-only array types. (4c3aaa0b1)

* Translated-message files moved out of `src/`, to `static`, to avoid
  spamming grep results. (1fc26a512)

* Upgraded RN to v0.57.8, from v0.57.1. (c03c85684^..ca759b106,
  329dd67f0)

* New script `tools/upgrade` to help systematize upgrading
  dependencies. (b64ce0023^..eb130c631)



## 21.2.106 (2018-12-12)

### Highlights for users (since 20.0.103)

Many fixes and improvements, including:
* Full support for custom emoji, including in composing messages and
  in reactions.

  lost.
* Complete translations for Italian and Korean.


### Full changes for users (since 21.1.105)

* Fixed a regression in 21.0.104: the autocomplete popup would sometimes
  not respond when touched. (#3209)


## (beta) 21.1.105 (2018-12-11)

This was a beta version that did not become a production release;
see above.


### Full changes for users (since 21.0.104)

  could show "No messages". (#3162)
* Fixed issue where uploading an image while viewing a stream would go
  to the wrong topic. (#3130)

  a server was rendered in a broken way, looking empty. (#3182)


### Full changes for developers (since 21.0.104)

#### Workflow improvements

* `tools/test` accepts a `--fix` option.  (177d3eaa9)


#### Architecture, interface, and quality improvements

* New internal API `withGetText` for acquiring a handy
  string-translating function, to use in any part of the app that
  isn't a React component. (#2812; c22dfee9b^..9eaa05c27)
* New experimental internal API for the (server) API bindings:
  `import api from ...`, then `api.sendMessage(...)` etc.
  (63ae59808^..acb979cf5)
* We no longer write `props: Props`, or where applicable
  `state: State`, at the top of each React component; the type
  arguments to `PureComponent` or `Component` express that already.
  (7e3becfba, c5df77962)
* A good swath of our uses of `any` and `Object` are replaced with
  real types, and 20 more files are marked strict-local; 60 to go.
  (9a0df7416^..60f14ed83)


## (beta) 21.0.104 (2018-12-05)

This was a beta version that did not become a production release;

  minutes idle. (#3190)
* Fixed issue where a draft message typed just after starting the app
  was lost. (#2861)

  corners, like individual avatars. (#3167)
* Fixed bugs causing top bar to sometimes be white instead of
  stream-colored. (#2797, #3139)

  small changes, <1s for no changes), by running only on files changed
  in the current branch. (977596d9e^..bd24bd1be)
* Spell-checker results are now pure warnings, free to ignore. (ff7bc2992)

  HTML. (#3156, #3170)
* New `caseNarrow` abstraction for working with narrow objects.
  (fa6134aa6^..e9fe1e801)
* Explain `Auth` vs. `Account` types, and introduce distinct
  `Identity`. (f5a2603a4^..28b1177d3)
* Applied `@flow strict-local` to most files and `@flow strict` to
  many files, fixing newly-exposed type issues. (#3164, 6efa7980c,
  2a96ede50, fa1b8a85c; 5ec1d3f9d^..597c51f6e; 5a2d49f85^..da5d519bf)
