# Zulip Mobile developer documentation

This directory contains documentation for contributing to the Zulip
mobile app, for iOS and Android.


## Getting the app

See the [main README](../README.md).


## Contributing

If you're interested in helping out with Zulip, please [install the
beta app](../README.md#using-the-beta) and report bugs :-).

To get started with the code, follow our [Developer
Guide](developer-guide.md).

Then see our [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and come
say hello in [the #mobile stream](../README.md#discussion).

To learn more, take a look through our developer documentation.
See below.


## Documentation overview

The key docs to read up front are the [main README](../README.md), the
[Developer Guide](developer-guide.md), and the [Contribution
Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

After you've gotten the development environment running, and said
hello in the #mobile stream in chat, some good things to read to learn
more include:

* [Architecture](architecture.md)
* [Glossary](glossary.md)
* [Testing](howto/testing.md)
* [our Git Guide](howto/git.md) (and try out all the example commands)
* [Debugging](howto/debugging.md) (linked from the Developer Guide,
  but worth rereading after you've done a PR or two)
* [Recommended Reading](background/recommended-reading.md)
* [WebView-specific](background/webview.md)
* ... and browse through this whole `docs/` subtree to see what else
  is here. ;-)
