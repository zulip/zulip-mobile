# Build and run the app

This guide describes how to build and run the app so you can develop it.

## Main steps

Before starting, install these dependencies if you don't have them:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), latest 8.x
  (LTS) version
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), latest stable version

If you are using macOS, upgrade to the latest version of the OS and then to
the latest Xcode.

Then, run the commands below in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile
cd zulip-mobile
yarn install
```

Unlike the [Zulip Server](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) project, we use
the host machine directly for development, instead of provisioning a VM.

To install the React Native tools, and either Xcode or the Android SDK
and Android Studio, follow the helpful instructions from React
Native upstream on
[Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
You want the tab "Building Projects with Native Code";
the "Quick Start" does not apply.

Continue those instructions until you can run the Zulip Mobile app
with either `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
You'll want to be able to use both an emulator and a physical device; but
for starting out, just get either one working so you can play with the app.

## Android tips

* To set up the Android emulator, follow the heading "Using a virtual device"
  in those React Native
  [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
  instructions.
* After you set up the Android emulator, you no longer need Android
  Studio.  You can start the emulator [from the command
  line](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline.html).
* When running on a physical device, if the device has Zulip installed
  from the Play Store, you may need to uninstall that version first.
* Commands once you've set up:
  * `react-native run-android` - build and run on an active emulator
    or USB-connected device
  * `npm run android-min` or `npm run android-max` - runs in an Android emulator, emulator has to be run manually before this command

## iOS tips

More wrinkles are involved; see our separate doc on [iOS tips](ios-tips.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Build failure: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError

When trying to build the Android app, you may see this error:

```
A problem occurred evaluating project ':@remobile/react-native-toast'.
> java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/android/build/gradle/LibraryPlugin : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
```

You can fix this by installing a recent version of the Java SE Development
Kit -- [JDK 8 or newer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).  You can check the installation with `java -version`,
which should show a version number starting with "1.8" (and not "1.7".)


### App shows a blank white screen

If you're developing on a Linux machine, and when you start the dev version of
the app (either in an emulator or on a device) you just get a blank white
screen, you may have hit your system's limit for inotify watches.  You can
increase this limit with the following commands:
```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Other issues

If you are having issues running the code on your machine, either for the first time or after updating an outdated code with the latest, please run:

```
npm run reinstall
```

Optionally, reset iOS simulator:

```
iOS Menu > Simulator > Reset Content and Settingsâ€¦
```

## Using a dev version of the server

This isn't required for most development -- you can use chat.zulip.org,
or another live Zulip community you belong to, for testing the mobile app.
But sometimes when debugging interactions with the server, or developing
server-side changes related to the mobile app, it's helpful to run the
mobile app against a development server which you control.

First, if you haven't already, you'll want to install and provision a
[Zulip Server dev VM](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html).

Then, you'll
* run the Zulip server in the dev VM with `tools/run-dev.py`, following the
  usual instructions for Zulip server development (linked above);
* fire up the app, go to the "switch account" UI, and enter a URL
  where the app can find your own Zulip server.

The details of how to get that URL to enter vary by platform.  See below.

(PRs to extend these instructions to cover other setups would be
welcome!)


### Android emulator and a dev server

First, confirm you can access your Zulip dev server in a browser, at
`http://localhost:9991/` (the standard setup).  This is *almost* the URL we
need; except that `localhost` inside the emulated device means the emulated
device itself, so we need to replace it with another name for your host.

Then, on the same host machine where you can do that in a browser:
run `react-native start`, and open the app in an Android emulator.
Hit "reload" in the React Native dev menu (or an equivalent keyboard
shortcut) to reload the app's JS code -- and pay close attention to the
green banner that appears at the top.  It will say something like
"Loading from 10.0.2.2:8081...".

The IP address that appears in the message is the one you want to use.
Borrow the scheme `http` and port `9991` from the URL you already use for
the dev Zulip server -- so to continue the same example, you would enter the
URL `http://10.0.2.2:9991/`.

Why does this work?  The green "Loading" banner identifies the IP address
and port at which the app is able to find your Metro Bundler server, the
process started by `react-native start`.  Therefore, that IP address is one
that works inside the emulated device as a way to reach your host machine...
which is also known as `localhost` when on the host machine itself.


### iOS device and a dev server

This process needs improvement and has too many manual steps at the moment.

First, you'll need to connect your dev machine and iOS device to the same
network. If you're running Zulip inside of a VM, you may also need to
configure your VM to use a public network. See more information on this [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/public_network.html).

Next, you'll need to change all instances of `localhost:9991` in both the
`/src` directory and the Xcode iOS project (located in `/ios`) to point to
the IP and port of your Vagrant VM.

Finally, run the Xcode project inside of `/ios` with your iOS device as the
target.
