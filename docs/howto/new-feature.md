# Adding a new feature

This guide describes how to add support in the Zulip mobile app for
a new feature in Zulip.


## Prologue: Interacting with the server

The first step in implementing the mobile side of a new Zulip feature
is to work out what it looks like in the Zulip server API.

 * If the feature is still in development on the server side, there
   should be a chat thread on `#api design` about what the API should
   look like.
   * If there's a proposed design there, you'll probably start by
     proceeding based on that.
   * Your feedback from implementing the mobile side will also be an
     important input for making revisions to the feature's API.
   * Note you'll need to [use a Zulip server development
     environment](./dev-server.md), so that you can have your
     development version of the mobile app talk to a version of the
     server based on the server PR for the feature.
   * Ideally we'd implement every new Zulip feature while it's at this
     stage.  But there's also a backlog of old features not yet
     implemented in mobile, soâ€¦

 * If the server side of the feature has already been merged, then it
   should appear in the Zulip API documentation, at
   https://zulip.com/api/.
   * If the feature was very recently merged, it may not have been
     deployed to zulip.com yet; try https://chat.zulip.org/api/.
   * If it was *very* recently merged (perhaps up to a day or two), it
     may not be on chat.zulip.org yet either; consult the server PR
     that added it, which should include documentation.
   * Changes to the API are documented at
     https://zulip.com/api/changelog , so that's a good first place to
     look.  That should then link to the pages with the details.

 * If the feature already exists on the server and you can't find API
   docs for it, ask in the `#api documentation` stream.
   * A small number of longstanding features don't have API docs yet.
     If you ask about one of those, you'll get answers on how it
     works, and ideally your question may cause the docs to get
     written.
   * It's also possible that the docs exist somewhere but were hard to
     find.  In that case you'll get the link and then we'll try to
     make it more findable, e.g. by cross-referencing from elsewhere
     in the docs.

In general, if anything in the API documentation is unclear or seems
wrong, or there's a question it leaves unanswered, please bring it up
in `#api documentation`.  That should produce an answer to your
question, and is also how we make the API docs better for the next
reader.

If the API seems less helpful than it could be -- e.g. if there's some
other data you'd like it to provide, or a better form of parameter
you'd like it to accept, or some change that would make it cleaner to
work with -- please bring that up too, in `#api design`.  (Often it
may not be clear whether a question belongs in `#api design` or
`#api documentation`; in that case pick either, and we can always
move the thread after we understand the issue better.)


## Adding to our API types and bindings

We describe in `src/api/` the Zulip server's API.  Any new feature
typically involves a change somewhere in the API, so the first step in
our codebase is to update our API code to reflect that.

Depending on the nature of the API change (as you find it in the
previous step), places you might update include:

 * `src/api/initialDataTypes.js` reflects the data returned by
   `/api/register-queue`, which is the initial snapshot of server data
   that we then keep up to date through
   [the Zulip event system](../architecture/realtime.md).

 * `src/api/eventTypes.js` reflects the data in those Zulip server
   events, returned by `/api/get-events`.
   * Some existing event types are described instead in
     `src/actionTypes.js`, so for changes to those you'll make the
     update there.
   * Any new event type should go in `eventTypes.js`, following the
     examples of the existing event types there.

 * `src/api/modelTypes.js` defines types such as `User`, `Message`,
   `Stream`, `Subscription`, that appear in the API and describe
   things in the Zulip data model.

 * Any new endpoint is reflected as a small file imported and
   re-exported in `src/api/index.js`.  See that file's imports for
   examples; see in particular `git log -p --full-diff src/api/index.js`
   (and [use the "secret" of `git log -p`](./git.md#reading-history))
   for recent examples.


Some general points about updating the API code:

 * Each chunk of the API code should have a link to the relevant part
   of the docs.  See [style guide](../style.md#api-doc-link) for
   details.

 * Our API code describes the full range of behavior we expect from
   the different Zulip server versions we support.  This means:

   * The type should cover both the new API and the old API.  For
     example, when an object the server returns gains a new property,
     the property should be marked as optional, like `foo?: boolean`
     ([Flow docs][flow-optional-property]).
     * This makes Flow able to check that our code handles both
       possibilities.

   * A comment should explain how the behavior differs by server
     version; see [style guide](../style.md#todo-server).  In
     particular:
     * Include a mention of the Zulip feature level.
     * Include a marker like `TODO(server-x.y):`, referring to the
       first server version that has the new behavior.

## Getting the data into Redux

### Making Redux actions

We turn Zulip server events into Redux actions in
`src/eventToAction.js`.  The action types are defined in
`src/actionTypes.js`.

 * For a new event type, add it to `GenericEventAction` in
   `actionTypes.js`, and add a `case` line to `eventToAction.js`
   following the example of `case EventTypes.restart:`.

 * For changes to an existing event type, check if any updates are
   needed in `actionTypes.js` and `eventToAction.js`.


Other parts of the API are reflected as Redux actions like so:

 * The initial data from `/api/register-queue` goes in a
   `REGISTER_COMPLETE` action (from `src/fetchActions.js`), which is
   transparent to any changes made to the type.

 * New endpoints generally are used only for making changes on the
   server, not for getting information back from it -- this is part
   of how the Zulip event system [maintains a consistent, up-to-date
   picture](../architecture/realtime.md) of the data on the server.
   So they don't result in Redux actions.


### The Redux state type

The data we maintain that comes from the server is described by
`PerAccountState`, in `src/reduxTypes.js`.  So when that data changes,
you'll want to make an update there.

 * Typically this will be inside one of the existing subtrees of that
   type; `RealmState` is the home of miscellaneous data like
   realm/org-level settings.

 * A small amount of data is actually (pending [issue #5006][]) not in
   `PerAccountState` but rather in the `Account` type, which is found
   under `state.accounts`.

 * The Redux state types reuse some of the API model types from
   `modelTypes.js`, like `Message` and `User` and `Stream`.  So if the
   updates you made in the API code were purely in `modelTypes.js`,
   then the state type may not need any further changes beyond that.
   (We'll still want a migration; see below.)

[issue #5006]: https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/5006


#### Redux state migrations

We store much of our Redux state persistently between runs of the app.
So whenever the type of the Redux state changes, we'll want a
migration to update any existing data, to ensure the data we end up
working with is actually of the specified type.

The migrations live in `src/storage/migrations.js`.  Add any new
migration to the end of the list there.

For most updates that reflect a change to the server API, the
migration will be simply `dropCache`.  This applies whenever the
change to the state type is purely in the parts of the state that
reflect data we can always re-fetch from the server.

We have unit tests for our migrations, in
`src/storage/__tests__/migrations-test.js`.  For a `dropCache`
migration, you'll make a small update there; for anything more
complex, add test cases as needed to cover it.  For examples,
see:
`git log --stat -p src/storage/migrations.js src/storage/__tests__/migrations-test.js`
(and [use the "secret" of `git log -p`](./git.md#reading-history)
to browse through those.)


### Reducers

Each subtree of our Redux state is maintained by a corresponding
sub-reducer, in a file `src/*/*Reducer.js` or `src/*/*Model.js`.
(The "model" way of organizing this code is more recent.)  These
are orchestrated by the overall reducer in `src/boot/reducers.js`.

 * When you've made a change to the state type, you'll typically also
   need to update the corresponding sub-reducer to maintain the new
   type.

 * When you've made a change to the `/api/register-queue` data in
   `initialDataTypes.js`, and hence to the contents of a
   `REGISTER_COMPLETE` action, you'll typically need to update one or
   several sub-reducers where they handle the affected data.  To see
   examples, use a search like: `git grep -A4 'case REGISTER_COMPLETE:`

 * When you've made a change to an existing action type -- in
   particular, when you've added a new event type or changed an
   existing one -- you'll typically need to update any reducers that
   handle that action type, and perhaps add a new case for it in other
   reducers.  To find existing references, try a search like
   `git grep -A4 'case EVENT_UPDATE_MESSAGE:'` (for events with their
   own legacy action types in `src/actionTypes.js`), or
   `git grep -A4 'case EventTypes.stream:'` (for events where we use
   `GenericEventAction`.)

 * For any change to reducers, be sure to add test cases to cover it.

 * If your change is purely to a type in `modelTypes.js`, like
   `Message` or `User` or `Subscription`, then the reducers might be
   transparent to the change and require no updates themselves.


### Selectors

For most new features, there's no need for a new selector function:

 * If the new feature adds (or changes) properties on a type like
   `Message` or `User` or `Subscription`, then code that consumes the
   data will get the message or user etc. from the state, and then
   refer to properties on it directly.

 * If the new feature is in settings, reflected in Redux by a new or
   changed property on `state.settings` or `state.realm`, then code
   that consumes the data will use the selector `getSettings` or
   `getRealm` respectively, and then refer to the property directly.


The main case in which a new selector or getter function is needed is
when the data from the server requires some interpretation that it's
useful to centralize, or when we maintain it in the form of a
nontrivial data structure so that we want to encapsulate an accessor
for that data structure.  For a simple example of the latter, see
`src/mute/muteModel.js` (and the definition of `MuteState` it
imports.)


## UI

### React

Most of our UI, we manage with React.  To get data from the state when
rendering a React component, use the functions in
`src/react-redux.js`.

 * Most often this means `useSelector`.  To see existing usage, try a
   search like `git grep 'useSelector\('`.

   * Specifically `useSelector` is a [React *hook*][react-hooks], and
     is how we get data from `PerAccountState` when inside a React
     function component.  For more on the behavior of `useSelector`,
     see [upstream docs][react-redux-useSelector].

 * If the React component type you're working on is a class component,
   this may mean `connect` (and there will typically already be a call
   to that, which you'll add to.)  See [upstream docs][react-redux-connect].

### The message list, in a WebView

The most important part of our UI that isn't in React is the message
list, which we show in a WebView.

 * The HTML for the message list is generated in `src/webview/html/`,
   for which the entry point is
   `src/webview/html/messageListElementHtml.js`.  This code is passed
   a message along with some other relevant data.

   * If you need here some data from the state that isn't in the
     message, then typically it should go into the `BackgroundData`
     type.

 * Your new feature may require some new CSS to style the new HTML.
   See `src/webview/static/base.css` and `src/webview/css/cssDark.js`.

 * If your new feature involves any interaction inside the message
   list, it may require some JS logic running inside the WebView.
   See `src/webview/js/js.js`.

   * That file is kind of giant.  New features should typically go in
     a separate file in that directory, imported from that file.

   * If you need an interaction inside the WebView to result in
     something happening outside of it, this is expressed with a
     "WebView outbound event".
     * See `src/webview/handleOutboundEvents.js` for where these are
       handled from the main RN environment outside the WebView, and
       for where the type `WebViewOutboundEvent` is defined.
     * Inside the WebView, call `sendMessage` to send such an event.
       See its call sites for examples.
     * Most of the call sites are inside our `click` (i.e., press)
       handler and our long-press handler.  If you're also responding
       to a press or long-press, add your new logic there, following
       the surrounding examples.


### Action sheets

The main example of a part of our UI that's neither in React nor the
message-list WebView (â€¦ other than the UI that's outside of React
Native entirely, which is basically just notifications) is *action
sheets*.  These are the menus we bring up when you long-press on many
surfaces in the app, offering ways to interact with a particular
stream, topic, message, etc.

Our action sheets are all constructed in `src/action-sheets/index.js`.
If you're adding a feature there that needs some data it doesn't
already have, then typically it should go into the `BackgroundData`
type.
