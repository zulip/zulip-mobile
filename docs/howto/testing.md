# Testing

Run `tools/test` to run all our test suites.  This command is
typically quite fast (5-10s, sometimes less), because it only rechecks
tests related to the files you've changed.

You can run all our tests with `tools/test --full`.

To see all options, run `tools/test --help`.


## Unit tests: JS

`tools/test jest` runs our JS unit tests.  These are written using
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

To write a test, place a Javascript file with the `-test.js` suffix in the
`__tests__` directory inside of any subfolder of `/src`. The test will be
automatically picked up by the test runner.


### Test style guide

* New test files should be `@flow strict-local`, just like all our
  non-test code.

* Tests should use the `exampleData` module as needed to produce
  objects of type `User`, `Message`, `GlobalState`, and our many other
  data types.

  * This typically allows a test to write out only the details
    relevant to it -- far less tedious than writing out lots of other
    properties that the application code expects to exist, but the
    given test doesn't care about the specific value of.

  * If `exampleData` doesn't already have code to produce the type you
    need, add to it.

* Lots of existing tests aren't marked with `@flow`.  If making
  substantial changes to a test file, first bring it up to our normal
  typing standards: add `@flow strict-local` and make it pass Flow.

  * Most of these tests build example data by hand, and to stay at a
    bearable level of tedium they leave out a lot of properties the
    real non-test objects would have, causing type errors.

    To convert such code to well-typed code, you'll want to use
    `exampleData` as described above.

* Use [deepFreeze](https://github.com/substack/deep-freeze) to test
  functions which access redux state. This won't allow the object to
  be mutated and hence will eventually fail tests in case of mutation.


## Unit tests: Android

We have a small, nascent suite of unit tests for our Android-native
(Kotlin and Java) code.

`tools/test android` runs this suite, as well as building all the
Android code.

Tests are written in Kotlin, using [JUnit 4] and the [Truth] library.
If you're writing Android unit tests:
* Definitely read the short Android guide on [principles of testing]
  -- it's a good writeup.
* Definitely also read the short Android guide on [local unit tests],
  which has more concrete details about the APIs we use here.
  * (A "local unit test" is Android jargon for a genuine,
    self-contained unit test, specifically a test that doesn't require
    an Android device to run on.  All our unit tests are "local unit
    tests".)

  and on [Truth][baeldung-truth].

## Functional tests

Functional tests have not been set up. We plan to use [Appium](http://appium.io/).


## Linting

We use [ESLint] to catch many kinds of style issues, together with
[Prettier] to maintain consistent formatting.

[ESLint]: https://eslint.org/
[Prettier]: https://prettier.io/

Our [lint config] starts from the Airbnb guides
([for ES6][airbnb-base] and [for React][airbnb-react]),
with a number of specific changes.

[lint config]: ../../.eslintrc.yaml
[airbnb-base]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
[airbnb-react]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react

Prettier is an "opinionated" tool, which is a euphemism for having
virtually no configuration options; and unfortunately a few of its
unchangeable "opinions" are outright harmful.  So we use
[prettier-eslint] to overrule it on those points; the details are in a
[small, formatting-only ESLint config file][formatting.eslintrc].

[prettier-eslint]: https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint
[formatting.eslintrc]: ../../tools/formatting.eslintrc.yaml

For proper results, always run ESLint or Prettier through our
canonical interfaces:
* `tools/test` (or `tools/test lint prettier` for these steps alone);
* `tools/test --fix`, to actually modify the files to fix issues where
  possible; or
* in your editor, with our [recommended editor config](editor.md).

If you find another interface more convenient, please send a PR and/or
mention it in chat!  We'll be interested to learn about it, and to see
what we can do to support it.


## Type checking with Flow

We use the [Flow][] type-checker on our JS code, and [flow-typed][]
for community-maintained type definitions for many dependencies.

Flow is not among the world's best-documented software.  If you don't
find something in its docs, it's worth
* searching [its issues][flow-issues] (including closed issues);
  sometimes a valuable feature is undocumented and the best discussion
  of it is where someone offers it as a workaround in an issue thread.
* scanning this ["cheat sheet"][flow-cheat-sheet] maintained by
  another Flow user, which provides an index of features both
  documented and undocumented.
