# Architecture

## High-level design

**zulip-mobile** uses Redux for state management and data flow. Please
read the [Redux docs](http://redux.js.org) for more information on the Redux
architecture and terminology (such as actions, reducers, and stores).

See [our React/Redux architecture doc](architecture/react.md) for a more
detailed explanation as applied to our app.

At a high-level, global app state should be immutable and is stored in
centralized place. Modifying state requires new copies of each data structure.

We use selectors to extract (or select) data from Redux Stores. [Learn more
about the concept of selectors](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ComputingDerivedData.html)
We might use [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) for memoized
selectors, when/if a need for more performance arises.

## Code structure

### Directories

* `/node_modules` - dependencies installed by `yarn` from NPM
* `/android` - auto-generated by React Native
* `/ios` - auto-generated by React Native
* `/docs` - developer documentation
* `/src` - Javascript source code

In general most of the work will be inside of the `/src` directory. The only
reason to touch the `/ios` or `/android` directories would be to add native
modules (which we aren't using at the moment).

### Top-level files
* `package.json` - specifies `yarn` / NPM dependencies and scripts for the project
* `.babelrc` - config file for [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler (ES6
  -> ES5)
* `.eslintrc` - config file for linting rules (we're using Airbnb rules)
* `.flowconfig` - config file for [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) static type
checker (unused)
* `index.js` - entry point for the app

### `/src` directory

The source directory is broken up into subdirectories corresponding to
components of the app:
* `account` - login, logout, and user account
* `api` - clients for the Zulip server API
* `common` - common components for multiple reuse (buttons, inputs, etc.)
* `compose` - composing messages
* `message` - messages and groups of related messages
* `nav` - navigation
* `streams` - stream of messages
* `users` - user display, search and selection


`ZulipMobile.js` contains the top-level React component for the app and
`boot/reducers.js` contains the top-level reducer.
