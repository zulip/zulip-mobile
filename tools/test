# Careful! `set -e` doesn't do everything you'd think it does. In
# fact, we don't get its benefit in any of the `run_foo` functions.
#
# This is because it has an effect only when it can exit the whole shell.
# (Its full name is `set -o errexit`, and it means "exit" literally.)  See:
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin
#
# When one test suite fails, we want to go on to run the other suites, so
# we use `||` to prevent the whole script from exiting there, and that
# defeats `set -e`.
#
# For now our workaround is to put `|| return` in the `run_foo` just
# after each nontrivial command that isn't the final command in the
# function.

## CLI PARSING

usage() {
    cat >&2 <<EOF
usage: tools/test [OPTION]... [SUITE]...

Run our tests.

By default, run all suites, but only on files changed in this branch
as found by \`tools/git changed-files \$(tools/git base)\`.

What tests to run:
  --all-files
              Run on all files, not only changed files.
  --diff COMMIT
              Run only on files that differ from the given commit.
              (E.g., \`--diff @\` for files with uncommitted changes;
              \`--diff @~10\` for files changed in last 10 commits; or see
              \`git help revisions\` for many more ways to name a commit.)
  --platform <ios|android|both|sloppy>
              Run tests as if on iOS, or Android, or both. The
              default, "sloppy", takes a shortcut in some suites,
              so the tests run faster but full coverage of both
              platforms isn't guaranteed. Specifically, "sloppy"
              will run both Android and iOS native tests, but will
              run Jest tests on only one platform (iOS). This is
              usually fine, because the vast majority of our Jest
              tests don't depend meaningfully on the platform.
  --all       In the given suites, run all tests on all files. Same as
              --all-files --platform both.

Extra things to do:
  --coverage  Collect test-coverage information.  Only meaningful
              with --all.
  --fix       Fix issues found, where possible.
