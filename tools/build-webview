# tools/build-webview: WebView assets collection script.

# CAVEAT EMENDATOR: Neither of the build systems have any visibility into this
# script's dependencies -- it is run unconditionally, and must ensure on its own
# that it performs as few actions as possible when nothing has changed.

usage: $0 [ios | android] --destination DEST [--check-path-name]

Build our webview assets, into directory DEST.

This script is mainly for internal use by our build scripts.  They
go on to use the contents of DEST as the webview-assets folder,
which our message-list WebView relies on for its static assets.
See src/webview/MessageList.js for details.

With --check-path-name, make some defensive checks that DEST has
the form expected from the actual build scripts.
