usage: tools/checkout-keystore

Temporarily decrypt the keystore file for signing an Android release.
For setup instructions, see docs/howto/release.md .

By using this, a release manager can ensure that the secrets are only
accessible for short periods when they're explicitly thinking about a
release.

This primarily guards against accidents: no slip of the keyboard,
no sharp-edged tool with surprising behavior in an edge case, and
no outright buggy tool can cause a validly-signed release build
unless the release manager has decrypted the key.
