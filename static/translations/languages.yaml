# languages.yaml: Configuration database for internationalization.

# The translation data files in `static/translations/` include all the languages
# we have open on Transifex for people to translate. This means all the
# languages that someone's expressed interest in translating Zulip into, and
# there are usually some that aren't yet much translated at all.
#
# To avoid offering users a translation into their language when it won't
# actually do anything, we maintain this separate list of languages that are
# translated to an adequate level.
#
# The Zulip webapp offers a language in the UI when it's over 5% translated.
# (Search for `percent_translated` in the server code.) The mobile app has no
# formal policy, but historically has added new languages when they're about 10%
# translated. The code-generation script that uses this file will complain if
# there are languages that are 20% translated (more or less), but not included
# in this list.
#
# We use a simple heuristic to determine the translation percentage locally; for
# a more accurate figure, consult Transifex [0].
#
# For the native names of languages, consult Wikipedia [1], or better yet,
# Wikipedia's own mobile UIs.  Wikipedia is a very conscientiously international
# and intercultural project with a lot of effort going into it by speakers of
# many languages, which makes it a useful gold standard for this.

# languages_used: The set of languages we offer in the Zulip mobile app.
#
# The keys of this map should match the Transifex identifiers. The order is not
# algorithmically important, but should be sorted by key for the human reader's
# sake.
#
# `generate-txn-import.js` will confirm that all of these languages are
# available to be provided, and also check whether there are others we should
# add.
