# How to help translate Zulip Mobile

These are *generated* files (*) that contain translations of the strings in
the app.

You can help translate Zulip Mobile into your language!  We do our
translations in Transifex, which is a nice web app for collaborating on
translations; a maintainer then syncs those translations into this repo.
To help out, [join the Zulip project on
Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/zulip/zulip/) and enter translations
there.  More details in the [Zulip contributor docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translating/translating.html#translators-workflow).

Within that Transifex project, if you'd like to focus on Zulip Mobile, look
at `mobile.json`.  The other resources there are for the Zulip web/desktop
app, where translations are also very welcome.

(*) One file is an exception: `messages_en.json` is manually maintained as a
list of (English) messages in the source code, and is used when we upload to
Transifex a list of strings to be translated.  It doesn't contain any
translations.
