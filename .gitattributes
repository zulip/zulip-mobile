# DIFFS: Noise suppression.

# Suppress noisy generated files in diffs.

# The flow-typed files that aren't pure generated noise have names with at
# least a major version number -- like `redux_v4.x.x.js`.

# DIFFS: Per-language drivers.
#
# In the output of `git diff` and `git log -p` etc., there's a handy
# "hunk header" on the `@@` line at the top of each hunk, to help the
# reader see what area of the code it affects.  This has a reasonable
# language-independent default, but Git also offers specific patterns
# for a few languages.  Use them, where they're better.
#
# Sadly there is no JavaScript pattern.  (And sadly for zulip/zulip:
# for Python the special one is worse than the default.)  For the list,
# see `git help attributes`.

# For Java, shows the method instead of the class; much better.
*.java diff=java

# For Objective-C, the default completely misses most function definitions.
ios/**/*.m diff=objc
ios/**/*.h diff=objc

# We don't currently have any CSS files, but let's bet on this being better.
*.css diff=css


# FORMATTING

# Maintain LF (Unix-style) newlines in text files.
* text=auto eol=lf
*.bat eol=crlf

# Make sure various media files never get somehow auto-detected as text
# and then newline-converted.
