Zulip Mobile is the official mobile Zulip client, supporting both iOS
and Android.


## Get the app

Release versions of the app are available here:
* [Zulip for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/zulip/id1203036395)
  on the iTunes App Store
* [Zulip for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulipmobile)

  * Or if you don't use Google Play, you can [download an
    APK](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases/latest)
    from the official build we post on GitHub.

You can also help out by [running beta versions](#using-the-beta) of

### Using the beta

One important way to contribute is to run beta versions of the app, and report
bugs!  To get the beta:

* Android: install the app, then just
  [join the testing program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.zulipmobile/)
  on Google Play.
  * Or if you don't use Google Play, you can [download an
    APK](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases/); the latest
    release on GitHub (including "pre-releases") is the current beta.
* iOS: install [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/testers/),
  then open [this public invitation link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ZuzqwXGf)
  on your device.

Bug reports are welcome either in [the #mobile stream](#discussion) or
on this GitHub repo.


### Development

Zulip Mobile is written in JavaScript with React Native.  To get
started with the code, follow this doc:
