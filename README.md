# Zulip Mobile
**Under active development. First usable version coming soon**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zulip/zulip-mobile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zulip/zulip-mobile)


Zulip Mobile is a new, cross-platform mobile Zulip client written in
JavaScript with React Native.

We target iOS initially, with Android version following shortly.

**Note**: We've decided that our React Native app is far enough along that it
makes sense to focus our efforts on making it better on
Android as well rather than maintaining the [Java Android app](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-android)
in parallel. Hence, this will soon be our default app for Android and iOS
platforms alike. Checkout our [detailed plan](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-android/blob/master/android-strategy.md)
for further details on the motivation and logistics.

## Why React Native?

* Support iOS and Android with one codebase
* Familiar web programming model (React + Javascript + Flexbox)
* Cross-platform, 90% code reuse between iOS and Android platforms

## Running

Run iOS:

* `npm run ios-min` - runs in an iOS simulator in the minimally supported device
(currently iPhone 5)

* `npm run ios-max` - runs in an iOS simulator in the newest/most premium
supported device (currently iPhone 7 Plus)

* `npm run ios-device` - runs on a physical iOS device, you need to edit the
device name in package.json

Run Android:

* Install the Android SDK including API 23 (Android 6.0), Build Tools, API Platform, Google APIs, Google Play Services, Android Support Library, the Local Maven Repository for Support and the Google Repository.

All of these can be installed, together with their dependencies, using the Android SDK manager.

* `react-native run-android` - runs in an Android emulator, emulator has to be
run manually before this command

## Fixing issues

If you are having issues running the code on your machine, either for the first time or after updating an outdated code with the latest, please run:

```
npm run reinstall
```

Optionally, reset iOS simulator:

```
iOS Menu > Simulator > Reset Content and Settingsâ€¦
```
