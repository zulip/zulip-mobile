Zulip Mobile is the official mobile Zulip client supporting both iOS and Android, written in JavaScript with React Native. It supersedes our two native apps [zulip-ios](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-ios-legacy) and [zulip-android](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-android).

Production versions of the app are available here:
 * [Zulip for iOS on iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/zulip/id1203036395)
 * [Zulip for Android on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulipmobile)

If you want to become a Beta tester:
* Android - get the [Zulip Beta on Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.zulipmobile/)
* iOS - get the [TestFlight App](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/testers/) and request an invitation in our [#mobile stream](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/mobile)
