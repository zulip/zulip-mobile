Subject: [tsflower] Resolve re-export indirection on CommonActions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

What's happening here is that this file has in the .d.ts:

    import type { /*â€¦*/ CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/routers';

and the latter module has:

    import * as CommonActions from './CommonActions';
    export { CommonActions };

and then finally the `CommonActions.d.ts` file has:

    export declare type Action = {

So when this file goes on to make a type reference
`CommonActions.Action`, that's using the `CommonActions` namespace
which it imported from react-nav/routers; where the latter made that
whole namespace be one of its exports.

TsFlower should handle this case.  There's no direct analogue to it in
Flow -- the only namespace a type can live in is a whole module, from
a namespace import like `import * as React from 'react'`.  But we can
always rewrite the type references to single names, and emit direct
imports for those.
