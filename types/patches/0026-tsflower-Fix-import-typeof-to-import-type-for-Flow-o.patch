Subject: [tsflower] Fix `import typeof` to `import type` for Flow-only types

I don't understand why TsFlower emitted `typeof` here; will have to
debug.

Probably a key part of the story is that although upstream imports
these as types, e.g.:

    import type { DirectEventHandler, Double } from 'react-native/Libraries/Types/CodegenTypes';

they don't actually exist in the TS type definitions in
`@types/react-native`.  They only exist as Flow definitions, in
`.js` files in RN itself.  This TsFlower behavior is what I'd expect
to see if when it asks the TS type-checker about these symbols, it
says that they *are* defined as values, but aren't as types.

(If that is the case, though, then I'd sure think these types aren't
doing any good in the upstream type definitions.  Perhaps they aren't?)
