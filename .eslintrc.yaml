# Our main ESLint config.

# Tips for developing on this file:
#
#  * To see what config currently applies, try a command like:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/types.js | less
#
#    or for a specific rule:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/types.js | jq '.rules["no-continue"]'
#
#    Especially handy for seeing the default or base setting, when we don't
#    configure a rule ourselves.
#
#  * A variation to canonicalize the config output for comparison:
#
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/foo.js | jq . --sorted >/tmp/foo.json
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/bar.js | jq . --sorted >/tmp/bar.json
#     $ git diff --no-index /tmp/{foo,bar}.json

  # ================================================================
  # Airbnb rule repeals / adjustments.

  # of Airbnb's settings where we don't want a full repeal.
  #

  # Tricky code.

  # Allow multiple classes per file.

  # where it's useful to have some tiny helper React components
  # declared in the same file as a main component.
  max-classes-per-file: off

  # Don't forbid prop spreading (it works fine for us)
  react/jsx-props-no-spreading: off

  # Don't enforce linebreaks in curly braces in JSX
  #
  # The difference this would make is minor, and leaving this rule off
  # better aligns with our practices in JS proper (not JSX).

  # Airbnb uses four selectors under 'no-restricted-syntax':
  #

    # ForInStatement: We agree to forbid 'for..in' loops.
    - selector: ForInStatement
      message: 'for..in loops iterate over the entire prototype chain, which
        is virtually never what you want. Use Object.{keys,values,entries}, and
        iterate over the resulting array.'
        # Further to Airbnb's explanation: They're also slightly buggy
        # in JSC [1], on which react-native is built... and,
        # surprisingly, their semantics weren't fully nailed down until
        # as late as 2019-12 [2]. But the above is reason enough.

    # ForOfStatement: We don't agree to forbid 'for..of' loops.
    #
    # Airbnb's style guide discourages language-level loops in favor of
    # array iterations. We don't share this controversial view; see it
    # expressed at https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1103.

    # LabeledStatement: We don't agree to forbid labeled statements.
    #
    # We don't really use them, but Airbnb's reasoning flows from their
    # anti-loop position, mentioned above, which we don't share.

    # WithStatement: Agree to forbid with statements, but not this way.
    # Instead, ...

  # ... use ESLint's built-in `no-with` rule to do the same thing more simply.

  # this seems just wrong [2], and there are a few places where we

  # that multiple tests in the same file aren't interfering with each
  # other by leaving bits of state lying around.
