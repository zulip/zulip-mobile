# Our main ESLint config.

# Tips for developing on this file:
#
#  * To see what config currently applies, try a command like:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/types.js | less
#
#    or for a specific rule:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/types.js | jq '.rules["no-continue"]'
#
#    Especially handy for seeing the default or base setting, when we don't
#    configure a rule ourselves.
#
#  * A variation to canonicalize the config output for comparison:
#
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/foo.js | jq . --sorted >/tmp/foo.json
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/bar.js | jq . --sorted >/tmp/bar.json
#     $ git diff --no-index /tmp/{foo,bar}.json

    #   "jest/no-deprecated-functions". If we don't provide it here,
    #   that rule will use `process.cwd()` to grab the Jest version
    #   from node_modules. But our VSCode plugin for ESLint seems to
    #   be changing the working directory in a way that interferes
    #   with that, and I haven't found the right value for that
    #   plugin's `eslint.workingDirectories` setting to fix the
    #   problem. Even if I did, though, that'd be one more thing to
    #   document as part of the dev setup, so we might as well fix the
    #   problem here.

  react/jsx-props-no-spreading: off

        # in JSC [1], on which react-native is built... and,

    # ForOfStatement: We don't agree to forbid 'for..of' loops.
    #
    # Airbnb's style guide discourages language-level loops in favor of
    # array iterations. We don't share this controversial view; see it
    # expressed at https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1103.

    # LabeledStatement: We don't agree to forbid labeled statements.
    #
    # We don't really use them, but Airbnb's reasoning flows from their
    # anti-loop position, mentioned above, which we don't share.

    # WithStatement: Agree to forbid with statements, but not this way.
    # Instead, ...

  # ... use ESLint's built-in `no-with` rule to do the same thing more simply.
