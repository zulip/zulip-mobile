  rules:
    # Here we repeal several AirBnB subrules.
    #
    # - The AirBnB rule disallowing labeled statements arises largely from their
    #   controversial hardcore anti-loop position [1], which we don't share.
    #
    # - The AirBnB rule disallowing `for..of` statements is partly based on the
    #   above. More reasonably, though, it cites the `regenerator-runtime`
    #   library (which Babel uses to implement them) as being too heavyweight.
    #   Unfortunately, we're already including `regenerator-runtime` for other
    #   reasons, and there's no easy way to find out what. (In for a penny, in
    #   for a pound.)
    #
    # - The AirBnB rule disallowing `with` statements has a shorter built-in
    #   equivalent. (And the parser enforces it in strict mode, anyway.)
    #
    # Alas, ESLint does not allow these repeals to be done surgically; we must
    # duplicate the entire acceptable portion of the rule. The original text
    # thereof can be found at [2].

        # They're also slightly buggy in JSC [1], on which react-native is
        # built... and, surprisingly, their semantics weren't fully nailed down
