Zulip has a high quality standard for merged code. This takes a bit of effort to get used to, but it makes Zulip better. Part of this is that it makes the project more accessible to contributors in the long run: careless bugs and unclear/missing explanations present some of the largest barriers to contributors, especially new contributors. We strive to avoid them. ðŸ™‚ Here is a list of mental notes you can use to help your PR be successful:

- I've read the style guide: https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/master/docs/style.md.
- My commits are clear and coherent: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/version-control.html.
- Each commit message has a properly formatted summary line and body, with attention to line lengths, etc. The reviewers read a lot of commits.
- I've tried to answer a reviewer's questions before they're asked. (See a list of examples in the style guide.)
- I've read these tips for changing my PR branch locally, so I know how to fix problems in my commits and update my PR: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/fixing-commits.html.
- I've read the Git guide, so I know how to inform myself about the history of the code I'd like to change: https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/master/docs/howto/git.md.
- All of my commits pass our tests, which I can run with `tools/test`. A shortcut for running it on all new commits in your branch is `git rebase --exec 'tools/test'`.
- If I'm changing the visual appearance of the app, I've made screenshots or GIFs to show the changes: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/docs/tutorials/screenshot-and-gif-software.md.
- If I just want feedback, and I'm not ready for a thorough code review, I've marked the PR as a work in progress: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/docs/git/pull-requests.md#work-in-progress-pull-requests.

That being said, please let us know, either here in the PR thread or on chat.zulip.org in the #mobile stream, what questions you have about the process. ðŸ™‚

Please also let us know your questions that arose while working on the specific changes in this PR. For example:

- "This PR removes some lines of code from `FooMachine` that were asking for help from some other code outside `FooMachine`. At first I thought `FooMachine` could do its job without help from that other code, but now I'm not so sure. Is that right?"
- "I think it would be good to make some followup changes to `FooMachine`. Should I add more commits to this PR branch, or make a new PR?"
