.*/*[.]android.js

; Ignore polyfills
node_modules/react-native/Libraries/polyfills/.*

; Flow doesn't support platforms
.*/Libraries/Utilities/LoadingView.js

; As of v4.1.1, this package only has TypeScript. That's fine as far as
; running the code goes -- Metro transpiles it -- but this line causes Flow
; to stop looking for types in that TypeScript, and then go and look in our
; libdef.

[untyped]

; Our libdef is more complete, as of 2021-08.
.*/node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage.*

[include]
; Effectively this line warns Flow that this path might be a symlink
; (because the developer might be using `yarn link` to have this point into
; their zulip.git worktree), and it should watch/inotify at the target.
node_modules/@zulip/shared/
node_modules/zulip-markdown-parser/
; Add more as needed!  See also metro.config.js and docs/howto/yarn-link.md .


[libs]

node_modules/react-native/flow/

; If the following files are not explicitly named, Flow ignores them in favor of
; their autogenerated versions in flow-typed/npm. (Contrast commit 6219e5a23,
; where the opposite behavior is exhibited!)
flow-typed/@sentry/react-native_v1.x.x.js
flow-typed/react-native-url-polyfill_vx.x.x.js
flow-typed/expo-screen-orientation_vx.x.x.js

; Explicitly name these so that Flow sees them instead of their
; counterparts in node_modules/react-native:
flow-typed/jest_v26.x.x.js

[declarations]
; We should be able to remove this once we're on RN v0.65, which has
; facebook/react-native@bac2c2c80. RN v0.64.2 was released without adding
; error codes to several `$FlowFixMe`s, so we'd otherwise get 12 warnings in
; this file, like
;
;   Suppression is missing a code. Please update this suppression to use an
;     error code: $FlowFixMe[invalid-export]
;
; We still want the module's types to be used, so `declarations` seemed like
; the best place to handle something like this:
;   https://flow.org/en/docs/config/declarations/
