 * A HOC for any server-data-dependent screen component that might be

 *
 * Prevents rerendering of the component's subtree unless we have
 * server data.
 *
 * The implementation uses props named `dispatch` and `haveServerData`; the
 * inner component shouldn't try to accept props with those names, and the
 * caller shouldn't try to pass them in.
 *
 * Inside a render method, don't call this directly: like most HOCs, it will
 * return a new value each time.  Instead, use `useHaveServerDataGate`.
