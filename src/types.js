 * in Flow, the only way a call to this function can ever be valid is when
 * the type-checker can actually prove the call site is unreachable.
 *
 * Especially useful for statically asserting that a `switch` statement is
 * exhaustive:
 *
 *     type Foo =
 *       | {| type: 'frob', ... |}
 *       | {| type: 'twiddle', ... |};

 *
 *       default:
 *         ensureUnreachable(foo); // Asserts no possible cases for `foo` remain.
 *         break;
 *     }
 *
 * In this example if by mistake a case is omitted, or if another case is
 * added to the type without a corresponding `case` statement here, then
 * Flow will report a type error at the `ensureUnreachable` call.

 * const { sender_id } = (message: MessageLike);  // ok!
 * ```
 *
 * * Note: `MessageLike` <: `Message | Outbox`, but the converse does not hold.
 *   It is therefore strongly advised _never_ to use `MessageLike` as either an
 *   argument or return type; instead, always accept and produce values of
 *   `Message | Outbox`, and cast them to `MessageLike` at their use-site when
 *   necessary.
