 * Assert a contradiction, statically.  Do nothing at runtime.

 * The `empty` type is the type with no values.  So, apart from certain bugs
 * in Flow, the only way a call to this function can ever be valid is when
 * the type-checker can actually prove the call site is unreachable.
 *
 * Especially useful for statically asserting that a `switch` statement is
 * exhaustive:
 *
 *     type Foo =
 *       | {| type: 'frob', ... |}
 *       | {| type: 'twiddle', ... |};

 *
 *     const foo: Foo = ...;

 *       case 'frob': ...; break;
 *
 *       case 'twiddle': ...; break;
 *
 *       default:
 *         ensureUnreachable(foo); // Asserts no possible cases for `foo` remain.
 *         break;
 *     }
 *
 * In this example if by mistake a case is omitted, or if another case is
 * added to the type without a corresponding `case` statement here, then
 * Flow will report a type error at the `ensureUnreachable` call.
