 * const { match_content } = (message: Message | Outbox);  // error
 * ```
 * is not allowed. However, as long as you're prepared to handle values of

 *
 * We therefore construct an intermediate type which Flow recognizes as a
 * subtype of `Message | Outbox`, but which Flow will permit us to directly (and
 * soundly) destructure certain `Message`-only fields from:
 * ```
 * const { match_content } = (message: MessageLike);  // ok!
 * ```
 *
 * * Note: `MessageLike` <: `Message | Outbox`, but the converse does not hold.
 *   It is therefore strongly advised _never_ to use `MessageLike` as either an
 *   argument or return type; instead, always accept and produce values of
 *   `Message | Outbox`, and cast them to `MessageLike` at their use-site when
 *   necessary.
 *
 * * Note 2: This class is asymmetric mostly because there is no current use case
 *   for accessing Outbox-only fields on a `Message | Outbox`.
