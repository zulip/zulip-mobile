 * A map with all messages we've stored locally, indexed by ID.

 * See `doInitialFetch` for discussion, and see our docs from the
 * client-side perspective:
 *   https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/blob/master/docs/architecture/realtime.md
 * and a mainly server-side perspective:
 *   https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html
 * As a result, there are very few types of data we need to go fetch from
 * the server as the user navigates through the app or as different
 * information is to appear on screen.
 *
 * Message data is the one major exception.  For new messages while we're
 * online, and updates to existing messages, we learn them in real time
 * through the event system; but because the full history of messages can be
 * very large, it's left out of the snapshot obtained through `/register` by
 * `doInitialFetch`.  Instead, we fetch specific message history as needed.
 *
 * This subtree of our state stores all the messages we've fetched, prompted
 * by any of a variety of reasons.
 *
 * Although this map is *incomplete*, it should always be *accurate* about
 * each message it does contain -- once a message appears here, we use the
 * Zulip event system to make sure it stays up to date through edits, emoji
 * reactions, or other changes to its data.
 *
 * These `Message` objects lack the `flags` property; we store that
 * information separately, as `FlagsState`.
 *
 * See also `NarrowsState`, which is an index on this data that identifies
 * messages belonging to a given narrow.
