/**
 * Get a temporary, authless partial URL to a realm-uploaded file.
 *
 * This endpoint was introduced in zulip/zulip@9e72fbe3f. The URL returned
 * allows a file to be viewed immediately without requiring a fresh login, but
 * it also does not include secrets like the API key. Currently, this URL
 * remains valid for 60 seconds. It can be used in various places in the app
 * where we open files in the browser, saving user's time.
 *
 * This endpoint is not in the Zulip API docs on the web, but it is
 * documented in our OpenAPI description:
 *   https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml
 * under the name `get_file_temporary_url`.
 *
 * @param auth Authentication info of the current user.
 * @param filePath The partial location of the uploaded file, as provided
 *    by the Zulip server to us in the message containing the file.
 *    It is a string of the form `/user_uploads/{realm_id_str}/{filename}`.
