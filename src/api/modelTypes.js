/**
 * A Zulip message.
 *
 * This type is mainly intended to represent the data the server sends as
 * the `message` property of an event of type `message`.  Caveat lector: we
 * pass these around to a lot of places, and do a lot of further munging, so
 * this type may not quite represent that.  Any differences should
 * definitely be commented, and perhaps refactored.
 *
 * The server's behavior here is undocumented and the source is very
 * complex; this is naturally a place where a large fraction of all the
 * features of Zulip have to appear.
 *
 * Major appearances of this type include
 *  * `message: Message` on a server event of type `message`, and our
 *    `EVENT_NEW_MESSAGE` Redux action for the event;
 *  * `messages: Message[]` in a `/messages` (our `getMessages`) response,
 *    and our resulting `MESSAGE_FETCH_COMPLETE` Redux action;
 *  * `messages: { [id]: Message }` in our global Redux state.
 *
 * References include:
 *  * the two example events at https://zulipchat.com/api/get-events-from-queue
 *  * `process_message_event` in zerver/tornado/event_queue.py; the call
 *    `client.add_event(user_event)` makes the final determination of what
 *    goes into the event, so `message_dict` is the final value of `message`
 *  * `MessageDict.wide_dict` and its helpers in zerver/lib/message.py;
 *    via `do_send_messages` in `zerver/lib/actions.py`, these supply most
 *    of the data ultimately handled by `process_message_event`
 *  * the `Message` and `AbstractMessage` models in zerver/models.py, but
 *    with caution; many fields are adjusted between the DB row and the event
 *  * empirical study looking at Redux events logged [to the
 *    console](docs/howto/debugging.md).
 *
 * See also `Outbox`, which is deliberately similar so that we can use
 * the type `Message | Outbox` in many places.
 *
 * See also `MessagesState` for discussion of how we fetch and store message
 * data.
