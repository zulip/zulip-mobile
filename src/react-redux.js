/**

 * Also always subtracts a given property completely, even if its type on
 * `L` happens to be more specific than on `U`.
 *
 * Assumes both U and L are exact object types.  (If not, behavior unknown.)
 * Returns a solution, where possible, to the type equation
 *   `U == {| ...D, ...L |}`
 * with an (inexact) object type `D`.
 *
 * More generally, returns the most general solution `D` to the relation
 *   `{| ...D, ...L |}: U`  (read "subtype of")
 * I.e., the most general type `D` such that `{| ...D, ...L |}` can be used
 * where a `U` is expected.  If there is no such `D`, causes a type error.
 *
 * In particular, this means:
 *  * Error if `L` has any extra properties that aren't in `U`.
 *  * Error unless each property of `L` has the same type as in `U`, or a subtype
 *    (i.e., the property's values in `L` are valid for `U`).
 *  * `D` has exactly the properties in `U` that aren't in `L`.
 *  * Each property of `D` has the same type as in `U`.

/**
 * Exactly like the `connect` in `react-redux` upstream, but more typed.
 *
 * The upstream function, and its libdef in `flow-typed`, has an extremely
 * complex type involving many overloads, and it's difficult to get useful
 * results with it from the type-checker.  This trivial wrapper leaves out a
 * bunch of features we don't use, and then gives a more specific type.
 *
 * (Most of those features probably *could* be supported with a more-helpful
 * type like this if desired, just with a moderate amount of further work.
 * Finding this type was a lot of work, and the extra features were left out
 * for the sake of focus while iterating on that.)
