   * The popular exponential backoff strategy is to increase the duration
   * exponentially with the number of sleeps completed, with a base of 2, until  a
   * ceiling is reached. E.g., if firstDuration is 100 and durationCeiling is 10 *
   * 1000 = 10000, the sequence is
   *
   * 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 10000, 10000, 10000, ...
   *
   * Instead of using this strategy directly, we also apply "jitter". We use
   * capped exponential backoff for the *upper bound* on a random duration, where
   * the lower bound is always zero. Mitigating "bursts" is the goal of any
   * "jitter" strategy, and the larger the range of randomness, the smoother the
   * bursts. Keeping the lower bound at zero maximizes the range while preserving
   * a capped exponential shape on the expected value. Greg discusses this in more
   * detail in #3841.
