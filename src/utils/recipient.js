/**
 * A list of users identifying a PM conversation, as per pmKeyRecipientsFromMessage.
 *
 * This is an "opaque type alias" for an array of plain old data.
 * See Flow docs: https://flow.org/en/docs/types/opaque-types/
 *
 * That means:
 *  * For code outside this module, it's some unknown subtype of the given
 *    array type.
 *  * Secretly, it actually is just that array type, and code inside this
 *    module can see that.
 *  * (In general, the public type bound and the secret underlying type can
 *    be different, but in this case we've made them the same.)
 *
 * As a result:
 *  * The only way to produce a value of this type is with code inside this
 *    module.  (For code outside the module, the secret underlying type
 *    could have any number of requirements it can't see; it could even be
 *    `empty`, which has no values.)
 *  * But code outside this module can still freely *consume* the data in a
 *    value of this type, just like any other value of the given array type.
 *
 * Or to say the same things from a different angle:
 *  * For code inside this module, this is just like a normal type alias,
 *    to the secret/private underlying type.
 *  * For code outside this module trying to produce a value of this type,
 *    it's a brick wall -- it's effectively like the `empty` type.
 *  * For code outside this module trying to consume a value of this type,
 *    it's just like a normal type alias to the public type bound; which in
 *    this case we've chosen to make the same as the private underlying type.
 *
 * See also `pmNarrowFromRecipients`, which requires a value of this type.
