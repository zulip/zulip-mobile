 *  * But code outside this module can still freely *consume* the data in a
 *    value of this type, just like any other value of the given array type.
 *

 *  * For code inside this module, this is just like a normal type alias,
 *    to the secret/private underlying type.
 *  * For code outside this module trying to produce a value of this type,
 *    it's a brick wall -- it's effectively like the `empty` type.
 *  * For code outside this module trying to consume a value of this type,
 *    it's just like a normal type alias to the public type bound; which in
 *    this case we've chosen to make the same as the private underlying type.
