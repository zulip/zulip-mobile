  /* $FlowFixMe - We make a small lie about the type, pretending that
     globalState is not void.

     This is OK because it's only ever void at the initialization action,
     and no reducer should do anything there other than return its initial
     state, so in particular no reducer should even look at globalState.

     Then on the other hand it's helpful because we want each reducer that
     ever does use the globalState parameter to require it -- so that Flow
     can help us be sure to pass it at the reducer's many other call sites,
     in tests.  That means it has to be `globalState: GlobalState`, not
     `globalState : void | GlobalState`.
