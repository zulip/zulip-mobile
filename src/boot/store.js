 * Drop all server data, as a rehydrate-time migration.

 * discarded any time the event queue expires and we make a new `/register`
 * call.  That's much more frequent than a new app release, let alone one
 * with a data migration... so forcing the same thing in a migration is
 * inexpensive, and makes a simple way to handle most migrations.
 *
 * One important difference from an expired event queue: `DEAD_QUEUE`
 * leaves the stale data mostly in place, to be clobbered by fresh data
 * by the subsequent `REALM_INIT`.  Here, because the old data may not work
 * with the current code at all, we have to actually discard it up front.
 * The behavior is similar to `ACCOUNT_SWITCH`, which also discards most
 * data: we'll show the loading screen while fetching initial data.  See
 * the `REHYDRATE` handlers in `sessionReducer` and `navReducer` for how
 * that happens.
