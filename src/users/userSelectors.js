  // valid possible state.  That means (a) we can't so easily tell that it's
  // out of sync, but also (b) the app's UI is not so likely to just crash
  // from the get-go if it is -- because at least it won't crash simply
  // because the state is empty.
  //
  // There're still plenty of other ways different subtrees can be out of
  // sync with each other: `state.narrows` could know about some new message
  // that `state.messages` doesn't, or `state.messages` have a message sent
  // by a user that `state.users` has no record of.

  // But given that shortly after startup we go fetch fresh data from the
  // server anyway, the checks above are hopefully enough to let the app
