// On Android, we could bypass this by arranging to use the old thing's

// order to control the database name fully enough.
//
// But on iOS, it's not so simple.  Values over 1024 characters
// (RCTInlineValueThreshold, in RNCAsyncStorage.m) are written as separate
// files.  Values up to that threshold go into a single JSON blob (for the
// whole key-value store) that's written as one file.  So rather than try
// to duplicate that, we just keep the legacy AsyncStorage as a
// dependency, and use it to read the old data if the new doesn't exist.

// Then once we're doing that for iOS, might as well do it for Android
// too, and not have to follow the old names.
