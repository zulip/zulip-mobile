/**
 * The action dispatched to rehydrate the store.
 *
 * This type is "overpromised" in that the type given for the `payload`
 * property is impossibly specific -- it allows the code consuming one of
 * these actions to make absolutely any assumptions it likes about the
 * payload.  Put another way, this type makes all kinds of promises about
 * the payload.
 *
 * A more truthful type would be `payload: { ... }`.  It's an object with
 * whatever data was retrieved from storage, which in particular may be from
 * an old version of the app's schema.
 *
 * TODO find a cleaner way to express this type.  A tricky bit is that after
 *   the migration middleware operates, the rehydrate action that it passes
 *   through has a more-specific payload type than `{ ... }`: it should
 *   actually be (a partial version of) the current schema.  So that
 *   more-specific type is what we write down for our reducers to rely on.
